# CM331-Handedness
Final Project for Washburn University CM-331 Class

Here are the instructions for running this program:

1. install the dependencies: the is a requirements.txt folder that you can run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
   to download all of the dependencies. Our team created a virtual environment and installed everything there.

2. Run the Classifier.py program with "python3 Classifier.py". This will build the dataset, compile and fit the 
   model, and then display two graphs.

3. (Optional) There is a predictions program that will let you run data through the model to predict. In order to do this, the data must have the shape (512, 64, 1) to run properly.
   Currently, it looks through the signatures that we did in the Fall 2024 semester and then gives predictions for them.
